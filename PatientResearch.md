What is Alzheimer's?
Major cause of dementia. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills. 

Early symptom of Alzheimer's:
1. Difficulty remembering newly learned information.
This can include important dates or events, asking for information over and over again, unlike a typical age-related change where people may forget something but can recall them later.

2. Having trouble concentrating.
Facing challenges in planning, solving problems or dealing with numbers. 3.Difficulty completing familiar daily tasks.

4. Losing track of dates, seasons, or place. 
They cannot figure out the passage of time.

5. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships.
Difficulty judging distance, determining color or contrast, which may cause problems with driving.

6. New problems with words in speaking or writing
Trouble carrying on a conversation. They may struggle with word choice, calling things by the wrong name.

7. Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps
Losing things occur more frequently. They cannot go back over their steps to find them again.

8. Decreased or poor judgment
Poor judgment when dealing with money. Or pay less attention to personal image.

9. Withdrawal from work or social activities.

10. Changes in mood and personality
They become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious. They may be easily upset at home, at work, with friends or in places where they are out of their comfort zone

In the early stages many people with this illness will retain good insight and may be conscious of their difficulties. Consequently they may feel embarrassed and frustrated, aware they are no longer able to do things that caused no difficulty in the past. Patients may be reluctant to see a doctor because they are afraid or not ready to hear about their condition. The person may feel stigmatised or labelled and may think that others will perceive all his/her behaviour as inadequate or clumsy.


For patients:
1. Correct information and advice.
Tell patients what it is, what causes this problem. Explaining to them why these changes are occurring. Maybe by showing them some light-hearted interactive animations to tell them more about Alzheimer's.

2. Stories shared by people who is also experiencing Alzheimer's.
It's not a shameful thing. No need to cover up or disguise the difficulties. how they can live well with dementia. You can tell people about the disease. Life goes on and you can still live well. Sharing the diagnosis may bring relief and make socializing a little easier since others may be more tolerant and understanding of the forgetfulness or changed behavior.

They often become skilled at adapting their behaviour and changing daily routines in order to avoid being confronted with upsetting or frustrating incidents. 

Experts working in the area recommend that people with dementia and their families should try as best as possible to be honest and open and continue to lead a normal life.

"I still pal with my same friends that I worked with. I still go out with them. I always go out on a Saturday night."

Practical Advice for Maintaining Independence after Diagnosis 
In the early stages of dementia, a number of practical measures can be adopted to enable the person to remain independent and to make daily living easier: 
• Keep a pen and a calendar with large writing spaces near the phone. 
• Write down all-important events such as appointments, social activities, due dates for bills, and medical visits on the calendar or into one notebook and check this notebook every day. 
• Write a daily to-do list and keep it in a visible spot. 
• If you are taking medication, keep it organized to make it easier to remember when to take. Use a medicine dispenser or a Dosette box or ask your pharmacist to blister pack the medications to facilitate correct dosage. 
• Keep a large clock in a prominent place in the living room and if possible get one that also shows today’s date. 
• Use a mobile phone which shows the day and date and programme frequently used numbers into your phone. 
• Make sure bills and other important papers that require attention are kept visible, this helps ensure that they will be dealt with.
